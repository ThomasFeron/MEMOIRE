### Root systems Generator and Deep Learning neural networks to predict phenotypes from experimental images.

The aim of these scripts is to

- Run CRootBOX in a batch mode in order to create any number of root systems, with any combinaison of parameters.
- Compile the parameters files.
- Generates the corresponding images.
- Design a Deep neural network.
- Train this Deep neural network to find out biological growth parameters from CRootBox images (from RIAJ proxies).
- Predict the phenotype of real scans of experimental root systems from this trained neural network.
- Classify real scans of root systems into different classes of phenotypes.
