### Root systems Generator and Deep Learning neural networks to predict phenotypes from experimental images.

The aim of this script is to

- Run CRootBOX in a batch mode in order to create any number of root systems, with any combinaison of parameters.
- Compile the parameters files.
- Generates the corresponding images.
- Train a Deep neural network to find biological growth parameters from CRootBox images.
- Predict the phenotype of real scans of experimental root systems from this training neural network
or
- Classify real scans of root systems into different classes of phenotypes
