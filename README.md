Root systems Generator and Deep Learning training to predict phenotypes from experimental images

The aim of this script is to run CRootBOX in a batch mode in order to create
any number of root systems, with any combinaison of parameters.
Once these roots have been generated and all the parameters compiled,
this script also generates the corresponding images.
After analyzing the images with RIAJ, this script also contains the neural network 
and its training in order to predict the phenotype of real scans of experimental root systems
